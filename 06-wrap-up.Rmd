## Import

* Read messy data from <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/carpentries-incubator/open-science-with-r/gh-pages/data/gapminder_wide.csv>.

## Transform

* Filter it to include data since 1980.
* Remove the column `continent`.

## Tidy

* Pivot the data on everything except `country`.
* Separate the messy column into `metric` and `year`.

## Visualize

Plot each metric through time:

* map colour to country
* facet by metric (free `scales`)

## Communicate

* Create a .pdf report.
* Download it to your computer.
